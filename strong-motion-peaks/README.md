# Strong Motion Peaks Summary

The spreadsheets in this repository summarise peak readings recorded by strong motion instruments in New Zealand sicne 1966. In all files the file identifier is linked to earthquake data including date, time (UTC), magnitude, hypocentral depth, and epicentral distance. They are not being updated at this time. 

### Description of Files
| File | Description |
|------| ----------- |
| Vol1 | Uncorrected peak accelerations |
| Vol2 | Corrected peak accelerations, velocities, an displacements |
| Vol3 | 0.5s period 5% damped spectral acceleration peaks |

### Definitions of Fields
- PGA: Peak Ground Acceleration
- PGV: Peak Ground Velocity
- PGD: Peak Ground Displacement
- SA: Spectral Acceleration
- R: Indicates depth is fixed
