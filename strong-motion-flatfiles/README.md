## Strong motion flatfiles

For selected large earthquakes, strong motion data have been specially processed, and associated metadata (e.g. earthquake location, parameters describing the recording site) have been compiled into spreadsheets. Common definitions of pseudo-acceleration response spectra have been precalculated and supplied in separate spreadsheets.
