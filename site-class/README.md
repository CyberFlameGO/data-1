#Site Class Information

These data are related to the site class and characteristics at locations of GeoNet instrumentation. There are two site class databases.
- A concise summary of site class information that is used in the New Zealand Strong Motion Database
- A extensive spreadsheet/database of site class information

_The concise summary currently has the most up-to-date information. The extensive database is undergoing some maintenance and is not currently up to data so please use it with caution._
